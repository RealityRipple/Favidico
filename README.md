# Favidico

Favidico is based on the [idea of Don Park](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2007/01/18/visual-security-9-block-ip-identification) to generate visually pleasing and easily recognizable icons from identifiers, such as IP addresses. The extension uses the CRC-32 code of the web page's domain name to seed the identicon renderer.

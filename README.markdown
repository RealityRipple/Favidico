# IdentFavIcon

IdentFavIcon is a Mozilla Firefox add-on based on the [idea of Don
Park](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2007/01/18/visual-security-9-block-ip-identification)
to generate visually pleasing and easily recognizable icons from
identifiers, such as IP addresses. I have used his algorithm to create this
extension, which replaces the default
[favicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) for web pages without
one. The extension uses the CRC-32 code of the web page's domain name to
seed the identicon renderer.

IdentFavIcon is [hosted at
addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7765).
